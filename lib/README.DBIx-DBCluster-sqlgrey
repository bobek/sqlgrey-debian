This package is included in the sqlgrey distribution for 3 reasons.

1. I couldnt really get dynamic loading, based on the existense of the module to work.
2. Ive added/changed a few things to DBCluster.pm. 
3. The module has disapeared from the official CPAN.

I wrote to the maintainer of DBCluster, but got no reply. So if i want to keep my additions, ill have to include them here :)

NOTE: If anyone knows of a module that can replace this one, that is still being maintained, please let me know.

The most significant addition is the WRITE_HOSTS_NEVER_READ option. 
By default, if you add eg. 1. write_host (eg. mysql master) and 1 read_hosts (mysql slave), this module will also use the write host for reading.

This is bad news in my setup.. Every mailserver has a mysql-slave running on localhost. 1 master-server takes all the writes.
So the correct setup is:
read_host = localhost
write_host = my-master.somewhere.net

Since i didnt want 20 mailservers doing reads from BOTH localhost and the master, i had to add this option that prohibits reads from 
write_hosts.
(This can be overridden if you add the master-sql as a read_hosts as well).


Other than that, im fairly sure that sqlgrey will work fine with the original DBCluster, if you should wish to do so.
